### 2.1 Answer:  What system prompt and user prompt did you use, and how similar were the outputs to what you expected? (you may also modify the expected output).

### 2.2 Test different combinations of temperature and top_p values. For Undergraduate students: run at least 3 different combinations. For Graduate students: run at least five different combinations. Record your experiments (combinations used) in the blank.

### 2.3  Run your code for the selected combinations and save the results. If you use Jupyter Notebook/Colab, submit a .ipynb file that includes both the code and the outputs for the different parameter settings. If you use a .py file, submit the code file and also save the outputs separately, then submit both. (We need both of your code and results)

### 2.4 Reflection: What interesting observations did you notice from your results? Which combination of parameters best matched your expectations? What were the temperature and top_p values for your best results?
